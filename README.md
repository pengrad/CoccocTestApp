You have to show movie image, movie name and release date.  
[Final app should look like this](https://github.com/pengrad/CoccocTestApp/blob/master/app_screenshot.jpg)
- __Please pay special attention to cleanliness and organization of your code__
- Send a pull request or project link to HR. We will review your app and come back to you.

### Advanced (will be a huge plus)
- We have specified our favorite libraries in dependencies, and we will be happy if you use some of them or maybe even all together, but this is completely up to you. 
You are welcome to wrap network requests with Retrofit and use any library for image loading.

- Open movie screen by clicking on list item https://www.cgv.vn/api/movie/movie/id/{movie_id}
You can create your own design of this screen.
